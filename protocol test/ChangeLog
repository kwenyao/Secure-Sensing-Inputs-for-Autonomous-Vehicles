2013-12-27  Josh Datko  <jbdatko@gmail.com>

	Adds check-mac from command line.  Closes #11.

	Adds check mac internals for issue #11.
	The MAC command now automatically performs a check mac to verify the
	mac (and meta data) are accurate.

	Adds const qualifiers on util functions.

	Fixes order of status packet checking for issue #13.
	Needs verification test.

	Adds offline-verify command.
	Adds the ability to verify a MAC produced on a Hashlet, without the
	hardware.  This is useful when a remote server wants to verify the MAC,
	but doesn't have an attached hashlet.

2013-12-26  Josh Datko  <jbd@cryptotronix.com>

	Adds parsing feature for key files.
	Adds parsing feature for generated and stored key_slot_files.  Uses the
	grammar defined in the flex and bison files to parse key files.  Changes
	the autotools setup files to accommodate flex and bison files.  Adds a
	print_keys command, which may not make it in the final release, to test
	the parsing.

	The parser will be eventually needed in order to verify a MAC or HMAC on
	a system that does not have a Hashlet (i.e. a remote server).

2013-12-26  Josh Datko  <jbdatko@gmail.com>

2013-12-26  Josh Datko  <jbdatko@gmail.com>

	although I have seen '-i' before.

2013-12-26  Josh Datko  <jbdatko@gmail.com>

	Refactored command line dispatcher.

	Added the MAC command to take in an arbitrary length file.  This depends on libgcrypt to guarantee a 32 byte available.  Another way to do this is to not directly depend on an external hash implementation, but to take in 32 bytes directly.  I think it's easier for the user to not have to pipe an external command first.
	If libgcrypt is not available, this feature will be not be enabled.

2013-12-25  Josh Datko  <jbdatko@gmail.com>
